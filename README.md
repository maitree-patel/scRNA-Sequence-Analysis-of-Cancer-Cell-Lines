# scRNA-Sequence-Analysis-of-Cancer-Cell-Lines
## Main Objective
Exploring scRNA-Seq data to analyze the use of existing FDA-approved antibody therapies on other cancers.

## Breaking Down the Question at Hand
**What are cancer-cell lines?**   
Cancer cell lines are tumour cells that continuous grow and divide that are used as models to study cancers. They are maintained under controlled laboratory conditions (*in vitro* to test therapies against cancers. Under appropriate conditions they reflect the genetic makeup of the source cancer. 

**why are cancer cell lines used to study cancers?**   
Characterizing their genetic properties can help us study diseases by testing compounds (potentials drugs) across them. 

**What is scRNA-Seq?**   
scRNA-Seq is used to study the transcriptomes of individual cells in tissues, i.e. gene expression profiles within each cells. It reveals heterogeinity in contrast to bulk RNA-Seq which combines gene expression values from the cells in a tissue.

**How does scRNA-Seq useful is studying cancer cell lines (what does it reveal)?**   
The heterogeinity of cancer cell lines are captured by scRNA-Seq allowing us to study response to drug therapies.

**What is HER2 and how is it targetted by Trastuzumab?**   
Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) are proteins that makes cells grow. Breast cancer cells are known to have HER2 as surface proteins. Trastuzumab binds to these proteins on cell surface to

**What were the main objectives of the paper?**

**Why?**

**How did the authors handle the potential caveat of co-culturing cell lines before profiling by scRNA-seq? Why do you think that caveat was or was not adequately addressed?**

**The authors identified discrete subpopulations of cells within a subset of individual cell lines (Fig. 2A-B). What might be the reason why some cell lines have these discrete subpopulations while others do not?**

**What are Recurrent Heterogeneous Programs (RHPs) and how were they defined?**

**How do the identified RHPs relate to in vivo programs of heterogeneity in tumors, and what evidence supports this relationship?**

**Where can you download the scRNA-seq data as shown in Figure 1B?**
