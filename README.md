# scRNA-Sequence-Analysis-of-Cancer-Cell-Lines
## Main Objective
Exploring scRNA-Seq data to analyze the use of existing FDA-approved antibody therapies on other cancers.

## Breaking Down the Question at Hand
**What are cancer-cell lines?**
Cancer cell lines are tumour cells that continuous grow and divide that are used as models to study cancers. They are maintained under controlled laboratory conditions (*in vitro* to test therapies against cancers. Under appropriate conditions they reflect the genetic makeup of the source cancer. 

**why are cancer cell lines used to study cancers?**
Characterizing their genetic properties can help us study diseases by testing compounds (potentials drugs) across them. 


**What is scRNA-Seq?**
scRNA-Seq is used to study the transcriptomes of individual cells in tissues, i.e. gene expression profiles within each cells. It reveals heterogeinity in contrast to bulk RNA-Seq which combines gene expression values from the cells in a tissue.

**How does scRNA-Seq useful is studying cancer cell lines (what does it reveal)?**
The heterogeinity of cancer cell lines are captured by scRNA-Seq allowing us to study response to drug therapies.
